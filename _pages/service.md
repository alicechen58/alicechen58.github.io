## Service Philosophy

My service work reflects my research interests in trauma, mental health, and resilience. Through crisis counseling, peer support, and wellness advocacy, I work to bridge the gap between research and community impact. I believe that everyone deserves access to compassionate, culturally sensitive mental health supportâ€”particularly during moments of crisis.

My training in psychological science and experience conducting research on PTSD, anxiety, and coping informs my approach to crisis intervention and peer support. I am committed to reducing stigma, promoting help-seeking behavior, and supporting individuals through some of their most challenging moments.
