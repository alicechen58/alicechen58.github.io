This symposium presentation explores how organizational support may buffer the negative mental health effects of morally injurious events (MIEs) on child protective services (CPS) workers. MIEs—situations where one witnesses, perpetrates, or fails to prevent actions that violate deeply held moral beliefs—are common in CPS work and can lead to significant distress.
