Welcome to my academic website! I'm Yuekun (Alice) Chen, a graduating senior at the University of California, Irvine, where I'm completing dual degrees in Psychological Science and Sociology.

## About This Site

I created this site to share my research, experiences, and academic journey with colleagues, collaborators, and anyone interested in trauma, resilience, and mental health research. Here you'll find:

- **Research Projects:** Information about my work across multiple labs studying trauma, PTSD, sleep, and mental health
- **Publications & Presentations:** My scholarly contributions including manuscripts in preparation and conference presentations
- **Portfolio:** Detailed descriptions of my lab experiences and research methodologies
- **Awards & Service:** Recognition I've received and my commitment to mental health advocacy

## Current Research Focus

My research interests center on understanding how people respond to and recover from traumatic experiences. I'm particularly interested in:

- Intergenerational transmission of trauma in military families
- Treatment outcomes in trauma-focused therapies like Cognitive Processing Therapy
- Mental health and resilience among high-stress occupations (e.g., child protective services workers)
- Cultural adaptation of mental health interventions
- The intersection of sleep, circadian rhythms, and PTSD

## Looking Ahead

As I prepare to graduate in June 2025, I'm excited about continuing to contribute to trauma and mental health research. I'm passionate about translating research findings into real-world applications that support individuals experiencing trauma and mental health challenges.

## Get in Touch

I'm always interested in connecting with other researchers, potential collaborators, and anyone passionate about mental health research. Feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:yuekunc1@uci.edu) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/yuekun-alice-chen).

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find the site informative!
